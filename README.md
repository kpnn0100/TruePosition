# True Position - Digital Signal Processing for Simulating Spatial Sound

Welcome to True Position, an open-source project designed to simulate sound behavior in a given space using the Digital Signal Processing Library. To integrate this functionality, you'll need to include the [Digital Signal Processing Library](https://github.com/kpnn0100/DigitalSignalProcessing) in your project.

## Functionality

True Position excels in providing a sophisticated spatial effect, allowing users to emulate sound propagation within a room. This is achieved through precise reverb and delay adjustments based on factors such as room size, listener position, and sound source position. The project is conveniently available in VST3 format.

## How to Use

To leverage True Position's capabilities, follow these steps:

1. Directly manipulate the position within the room visualization cube to modify the sound source's location.

2. Utilize the following knobs to fine-tune the sound:

   - **Dry:** Adjust the main source gain.
   - **Wet:** Fine-tune the bouncing gain.
   - **Reverb:** Control the reverb gain.
   - **Decay:** Determine the length of the reverb effect.
   - **Lowcut:** Set the low-cut filter for both reverb and delay.
   - **Highcut:** Specify the high-cut filter for both reverb and delay.

This comprehensive tool empowers users to achieve a nuanced and realistic spatial audio experience. Incorporate True Position into your projects for enhanced sound simulation capabilities.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the [Digital Signal Processing Library](https://github.com/kpnn0100/DigitalSignalProcessing) for a seamless integration with True Position. Your contributions are valued as we strive to create an immersive audio environment for all users.
